  "description": "etcd should be configured to make use of TLS encryption for peer connections.",
  "remediation": "Follow the etcd service documentation and configure peer TLS encryption as appropriate for your etcd cluster.\n\n Then, edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the master node and set the below parameters.\n\n \n```\n--peer-client-file=</path/to/peer-cert-file>\n--peer-key-file=</path/to/peer-key-file>\n\n```\n\n#### Impact Statement\netcd cluster peers would need to set up TLS for their communication.\n\n#### Default Value\n**Note:** This recommendation is applicable only for etcd clusters. If you are using only one etcd server in your environment then this recommendation is not applicable.\n\n By default, peer communication over TLS is not configured.",
